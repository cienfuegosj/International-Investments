    "We want to make sure that Charles gets the most out of his investments with this new tax reform put in place, so we want to maximize the net interest amount. Let $x_1$ be the amount in DM to be sold for year 5, $x_2$ be the amount in DM to be sold for year 6, and $x_3$ the amount in DM to be sold for year 7. If we assumed no tax for the moment, we would construct the following linear program:\n",

    "Since this linear program does not take into account the tax reform, let's assume $x_1$ is composed of two components, the amount in DM to be sold for year 5 that will not incur any taxes on the interest and the amount in DM to be sold for year 5 that <b>will</b> incur a tax cost on the interest. Let this be define similarly for $x_2, x_3$. Let's call the two components just mentioned $x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}$. This means that $x_i = x_{i,1} + x_{i,2}$. One concern is the objective function. So the untaxed amount of B-Bonds sold i.e $x_{i,1}$ will be able to get an interest return of their respective values on the table. On the other hand, the amount of B-Bonds sold i.e $x_{i,j}$ will only be $(1-T)\\times I_{i} \\times x_{i,2}$ where $T$ stands for the tax rate of the interest and $I_{i}$ stands for the interest percent for selling.

    "(b) asks \"what is fundammentally wrong with the advice Charles got from the investment adviser at the bank?\". What is wrong is that the adviser is only taking into consideration the tax rate for that specific year (7th year), but we have to take into account all of the interest for every given year. We aren't just paying 30% on the interest rate for the last year, but we are paying 30% on the interest gained from every year.\n",

    "(c) Since Certificate of Deposits can be bought for any amount and they also have a maturity date with a given interest rate, Charles could use the interest he has accumulated for each year to buy these CDs and sell them the next year. I'm assuming that he will be selling his CDs on the same date he sells his B-Bonds. Let $y_1$ be the amount of CDs bought in year 5 and will be redeemed in year 6. Let $y_2$ be the amount of CDs bought in year 6 and will be redeemed in year 7. Since Charles needs the money for school immediately, he will not be interested in buying CDs on year 7, so we have only an additional of $y_1, y_2$ to worry about. If the CDs bought in year 5 that will be redeemed on year 6 makes an interest of less than or equal to 6100, then it would be untaxed and build a total interest of $0.04 \\times y_1$. Let this apply to $y_2$. If the CDs bought in year 5 that will be redeemed on year 6 makes an interest of more than 6100, then it would be taxed at 30% and only get an interest of $0.028$. Let this apply to $y_2$ as well. Since the amount of CDs bought for both years consists of amount that will be taxed and untaxed, we will break up each one of them into two components: amount of CDs that when sold will be taxed and the other is the amount of CDs that when sold will not be taxed.\n",
